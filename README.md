# Overview

As a software engineer, it's important to not just know multiple programming languages, but to know how to learn them outside of a classroom. I started this project not knowing any Rust, with the goal to learn Rust and be able to write a functioning program with it. 

This program is a password manager application. It allows the user to create and save entries that consist of a website and a password to that website, so that the user can remember all the different passwords they have. Once set up, the program requires authorization so that only the original user can access their passwords.

In this day of technology, there are so many different things that was us to create a username and a password, all with their own unique requirements. It can be hard to remember every single password that you have, especially if you're using some kind of algorithm to make them stronger. This program is meant to help the user remember passwords in a secure way.

# Development Environment

The development environment I used was VS code.

The language I used was Rust.

# Useful Websites

{Make a list of websites that you found helpful in this project}

- [Rust documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html)

# Future Work

- Fix the authorization feature
- Fix the saving and loading -- currently the write function writes to multiple lines instead of one, which messes with the save function. I need to do more research and figure out how to write multiple parts of a dictionary to one line.
- Include password suggestions based of an algorithm or hashing.
